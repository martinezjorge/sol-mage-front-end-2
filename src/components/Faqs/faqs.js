      Mint Date: 1/12/22

      Mint Price: 0.1 Sol

    Sol Mage Society was stealth launched on 1/12/22. We didnâ€™t want a large pre-marketing push and instead took a grassroots approach for the project. 
  </p>

    66/666 out of the supply contains treasure chests as a background layer on your Sol Mage NFT.

  <p>
    Help shape the future of Sol Mage Society by being granted access to the exclusive Lich Dao discord channel where your feedback will impact upcoming changes by holding a treasure chest mage! 
    <br/>
    These chests give the holder free drops, more access, and a special Phylactery to transform your mage into a powerful Lich Mage. 
    <br/>
    Holding a treasure chest will grant whitelist opportunities and airdrops to GEN 1 releases in addition to revenue sharing for all future collections. Treasure chests will grant access to future projects created in the Sol Mage Metaverse and are highly sought after.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lich Mages is a special in-game ability that allows you to transform your Sol Mage NFT into a Lich Mage. Doing so unlocks a new list of abilities that are highly powerful but come with a cost being that you are much more vulnerable to damage. To gain this ability you must obtain a Lich Phylactery which will be airdropped to all treasure chest holders or obtain one on the secondary market (Magic Eden.) The airdrop will be announced shortly for treasure chest holders so keep an eye out on the discord server for updates!

    33% of royalties will be airdropped to Treasure Chest holders

    33% of royalties will be sent to the development treasury.

  <p>
    This will be coming soon. Every Sol Mage NFT has a variety of different spells and abilities. Theorycrafting meta abilities and skillsets will be a huge part about climbing the top of the Sol Mage leaderboards and providing the most damage output to get the best prizes in the PvE game modes.
